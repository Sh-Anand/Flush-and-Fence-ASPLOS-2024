A non-invalidating \wb{} may seem like the best idea, but there are times you may want to invalidate the data you've just accessed, for example when writing streaming data to a device ring-buffer.
In this case, you likely will not access the same data again, and instead would prefer to make room in your cache for actually warm data, thus the \fl{}.
