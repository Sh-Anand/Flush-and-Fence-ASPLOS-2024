\MG{This will probably have a detailed explanation of RISC-V, ChipYard~\cite{Asanovic:ChipYard:2016}, TL~\cite{Cook:Diplomatic:2017,Terpestra:TileLink:2017}, etc.}
\subsection{RISC-V}
\MG{Discuss \cite{Waterman:Riscv:2011}, possibly merge with BOOM section if too small}
RISC-V\cite{Waterman:Riscv:2011} is an open standard reduced Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The distinguishing feature of RISC-V being free and open source eliminates the need for licenses in implementing the ISA, thereby removing the legal impediments associated with developing open source hardware and related software toolchains.
